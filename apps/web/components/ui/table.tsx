/**
 * The one table vocabulary — docs/design-system.md §4 (13px body, tabular
 * figures for numbers) and §8.1's roster. Roster, Cycles and Students each
 * hand-rolled the identical `w-full text-[13px]` / muted `<th>` / `border-top
 * 1px var(--line)` chrome; this is that chrome, once.
 *
 * `numeric` on a cell selects right alignment and tabular figures — a column
 * of counts that does not line up is the specific thing §4's tabular-figures
 * rule exists to prevent. Pass it on the `Th` as well as the `Td`, or the
 * header sits left while its value sits right and reads as belonging to the
 * next column along.
 *
 * Horizontal padding is `px-3` (12px), the TOP of design-system §5's "roster
 * uses 8–12px row padding" range, while vertical stays `py-2` (8px). At
 * `px-2` both ways a right-aligned column's value ended up 16px from the next
 * left-aligned column's — the roster's Entries count read as though it were
 * in Extra. Vertical density is the "dense core" signal in §5 and is
 * deliberately not loosened with it.
 *
 * A `numeric` cell then takes `pr-6` (24px) instead of `pr-3`, so its
 * right-aligned value is INSET from the boundary rather than parked against
 * it. §5's 12px ceiling is a row-padding budget and 12px symmetric was not
 * enough here: a right-then-left column pair aligns its two values TOWARD
 * each other by construction, so a short glyph on each side of the boundary
 * reads as one unit however wide the columns are. The roster's `—` under
 * Extra (cycle) and `—` under Absence reason were the case that proved it —
 * 24px apart and still reading as the pair `— —`. Header and cell both carry
 * it, so they stay aligned with each other; the numeric column's own LEFT
 * gap stays 12px, because the column before it is left-aligned and its text
 * ends nowhere near the boundary.
