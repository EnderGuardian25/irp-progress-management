# Handoff — IRP Progress Management System

**Created:** 2026-07-27
**Origin:** split out of `bistec-intern-onboarding` (Month 2 Internal Project Sprint)
**Target location:** `D:\Bistec\irp-progress-management`
**Team:** Damian De Cruz, solo (all three BMAD roles — see `docs/interview-and-prd.md` §4)
**Stakeholder / decision owner:** IRP Mentor, Bistec Hearts Academy (contact via Teams)

## 0. Where this folder lives

This folder was authored inside the onboarding repo and **copied** to its own location:

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `D:\Bistec\irp-progress-management\` | **The build repo. Authoritative. Work here.** |
| `D:\Bistec\bistec-intern-onboarding\weekly-challenges\month-2\irp-progress-management\` | Frozen snapshot, committed as part of the Month 2 submission record. Do not build here |

If you are reading this at the onboarding-repo path, you are in the snapshot — switch to `D:\Bistec\irp-progress-management`.

Still to do in the build repo:

```powershell
cd "D:\Bistec\irp-progress-management"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "chore: initial commit — PRD, interview record, and project guidance"
gh repo create irp-progress-management --private --source . --push   # or create it in the Bistec org
```

Copies of the PRD, the interview record, and the brief also sit directly under the onboarding repo's `weekly-challenges/month-2/` as the graded submission artefacts. **This repo is authoritative for building.** If a requirement changes, change it here — then copy back to the onboarding repo if the submission copy needs to match.

## 1. State of play

### Done
- **Stakeholder interview** — conducted and answered. `docs/stakeholder-interview.md`.
- **Deliverable 1 — Interview Record + Problem Statement + PRD + Team Contract** — drafted. `docs/interview-and-prd.md`. Contains 32 numbered FRs, 15 NFRs with numeric targets, 12 non-goals, and a traceability table back to the stakeholder's success criteria.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — stack, layout, house rules, domain glossary, hard boundaries.

### Not started
Everything else. No code exists yet — no scaffold, no spec, no infra.

### Blocked / needs the stakeholder
| # | Item | Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| O-1 | Interview date, duration, stakeholder name for the record | Deliverable 1 final submission only |
| O-5 | **AI provider decision + data-processing approval.** Student submissions are personal data leaving the tenant | The whole AI evaluation slice (FR-22 to FR-26). Needs an ADR and escalation to Hearts Academy / leadership before any model API is wired |
| O-6 | Exact wording of the five rubric criteria | Prisma schema for evaluations |
| O-2, O-3, O-7 | Email delivery in v1; winner tie-break rule; whether lateness/absence penalises the score | Reporting and scoring slices — assumptions are stated, proceed behind them and mark `// ASSUMPTION: O-n` |
| — | Demo Day #2 date | Scheduling only |

Full list: `docs/interview-and-prd.md` §5.

## 2. Build task list

Ordered. Each task names the deliverable it feeds and the FRs it covers. Do them as branch + PR, one story per PR.

### Phase 1 — Foundations
| # | Task | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| T-01 | pnpm workspace monorepo scaffold: `apps/web`, `apps/api`, `packages/types`, `packages/client`, `spec/`, `infra/`, `tests/load/`, `docs/adr/`, `docs/stories/`. TypeScript strict everywhere | D2 |
| T-02 | ADRs. **Done:** 0001 Tailwind + shadcn/ui · 0002 light-default theming · 0003 cycle ribbon for FR-28. **Remaining:** monorepo tooling; AI provider (**blocked on O-5**). Numbering is chronological by decision — the bootstrap "record architecture decisions" ADR is redundant, `CLAUDE.md` already carries that convention | D2 |
| T-03 | Baseline GitHub Actions workflow: install → lint → typecheck → test → redocly lint. Runs on PR | D2 |
| T-04 | Story breakdown — write `docs/stories/S-0xx-*.md` from the FRs, with acceptance criteria per story | D1/D2 |

### Phase 2 — Data model
| # | Task | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| T-05 | Prisma schema: `User`, `Batch`, `Enrolment`, `Entry`, `DailyReport`, `AbsenceRecord`, `Cycle`, `Evaluation`, `Override`, `Award`. Soft-delete on students | FR-5, FR-6, FR-8 |
| T-06 | Cycle/date engine: 10th→9th boundaries anchored to admission date, Asia/Colombo evaluation, weekday-only arithmetic, grace-window and late determination. **Unit-test this hard — it's the subtlest logic in the system** | FR-9, FR-12, FR-13, FR-14, NFR-12 |
| T-07 | Seed script: 2 batches, 10 students, a month of realistic entries including late and absent days | D2 |

### Phase 3 — API contract (Deliverable 2)
| # | Task | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| T-08 | Hand-write `spec/openapi.yaml`: auth, students, batches, entries, daily reports, absence, review transitions, evaluations, overrides, awards, dashboards. Every endpoint 200/400/401/500; RFC 7807 error body; `additionalProperties: false`; examples on every schema | FR-1..FR-32, NFR-7, NFR-8 |
| T-09 | Wire generation into CI: `openapi-typescript` → `packages/types`, `@hey-api/openapi-ts` → `packages/client`. Fail the build if generated output is stale | D2 |
| T-10 | Fastify handlers typed off the generated `paths`. Strict request validation returning Problem Details | FR-1..FR-21 |

### Phase 4 — Application
| # | Task | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| T-11 | Azure AD SSO on both apps; Admin/Student role gating; no local passwords | FR-1..FR-4, NFR-14 |
| T-12 | Student daily submission flow: text-only, multiple entries/day, current-or-previous-weekday only, absence marking. Under 2 min to submit | FR-10..FR-17, NFR-9 |
| T-13 | Mentor review flow: Submitted → In Review → Evaluated, mentor's own attendance/task record, lock on Evaluated. **No reject state** | FR-18..FR-20 |
| T-14 | Mentor dashboard — performance summary + "N of M submitted today" + late/absent counts, no scrolling. **Ship this first; it is the stakeholder's must-have** | FR-28, SC-4 |
| T-15 | Student dashboard — own history, "Month N of 6", strengths-and-weaknesses summary. No score, no rank, no other students | FR-29, FR-30 |
| T-16 | Teams + email notifications on submission and state change | FR-21 |
| T-17 | AI monthly evaluation: summary generation, fixed-rubric scoring (20/25/25/10/20), mentor override with reason, no summary editing, no mid-cycle evaluation. Persist model version + score. **Blocked on O-5** | FR-22..FR-27, NFR-15 |
| T-18 | Winner computation + downloadable PDF with AI justification | FR-31, FR-32 |

### Phase 5 — Deploy & observability (Deliverable 3)
| # | Task | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| T-19 | `infra/main.bicep` — Container Apps, Postgres 16, App Insights, Azure AD app registration. No portal clicks | D3 |
| T-20 | Deploy workflow to Azure Container Apps on merge to `main`, under 8 min | D3, NFR-5 |
| T-21 | OpenTelemetry → App Insights, every route traced, visible within 60 s | D3, NFR-6 |
| T-22 | Tested rollback path to the previous revision, with exact commands | D3 |
| T-23 | `deploy-runbook.md` — infrastructure, pipeline, auth, observability, rollback | D3 |

### Phase 6 — Load test & retro (Deliverable 4)
| # | Task | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| T-24 | k6 scripts in `tests/load/`: sustained 50 RPS, 200 RPS burst, auth-gated 10 RPS × 5 min, 30 min idle memory watch | D4, NFR-1..NFR-4 |
| T-25 | Run them, capture results, analyse the slowest endpoint citing App Insights traces | D4 |
| T-26 | `retro-and-load.md` — start/stop/continue (≥3 each), velocity vs estimate, honest notes on solo multi-agent orchestration, results table, bottlenecks, follow-ups with owners and dates | D4 |

### Phase 7 — Post-demo (before Month 3)
Fix every P1/P2 from the stakeholder demo · Dependabot + weekly patch rotation · postmortem for the worst sprint day · convert one endpoint to typed-SDK-only · pin an App Insights dashboard in the README · pair-review two other teams' OpenAPI specs.

## 3. Suggested next action

Start with **T-01 → T-04**, then **T-06** (the cycle/date engine) before anything else touches dates — late/absent/grace logic is where this project will quietly go wrong, and every downstream feature depends on it being right.

Then **T-08** (the spec), because Deliverable 2 is scored on the spec's completeness and nothing in `apps/` should be written before the contract exists.

Sequence T-14 early once the API is up — the stakeholder said if only one thing ships, it is the performance summary dashboard plus the daily submission count.

Leave T-17 until O-5 is resolved. Everything else can proceed around it.

## 4. Things not to re-litigate

- The stack is fixed by the programme (Fastify / Postgres 16 / Prisma / Azure Container Apps / Bicep / GitHub Actions). **One row has moved:** the frontend is Next.js **16**, not the pinned 15 — [ADR-0004](docs/adr/0004-nextjs-16-over-pinned-15.md), mentor sign-off pending as O-12. Exact version pins live in `CLAUDE.md`.
- There is **no reject state** in review, no configurable rubric, no file uploads, no student-visible scores or ranks, no mobile layout, no data migration, no admin date-correction. Full list in `CLAUDE.md` under "Hard boundaries".
- Grading and rubric language was deliberately kept out of `docs/stakeholder-interview.md` — that document is requirements input, not a graded exercise. Don't re-add it.
- The five-whys chain did **not** land on fairness or dispute-resolution; the stakeholder rejected that framing outright. The driver is evaluation cost and handover legibility. Don't design for dispute-proofing.
